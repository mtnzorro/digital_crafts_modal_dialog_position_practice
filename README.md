ABSOLUTE/FIXED POSITIONING

Instructions from the practice assignment:

**
Using fixed positioning and absolute positioning, you can create a modal dialog that sits in the middle of the page and appears on top of the rest of the page content.

You have a page with some place holder content in it. Also, there's the following markup for a pop-up modal dialog:

<div class="modal-dialog">
<div class="modal-header"><label class="modal-title">Hello</label></div>
<div class="modal-content">
<p>Would you like to subscribe to our email newsletter?</p>
</div>
<div class="modal-buttons"><button>Ok</button> <button>Cancel</button></div>
</div>

Bonus Challenge

Semi-gray out the rest of the content on the page, and add a drop shadow to the modal dialog, as is shown in the bonus challenge screenshot. And while we are at it might as well add a little rounded corner to the dialog. You may need to add additional HTML element(s) to the page to achieve this effect.

**

Repo includes the files that account for both the basic and bonus practice.
